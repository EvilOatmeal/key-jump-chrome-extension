Pointing and clicking with your mouse can be annoying, especially if you're someone who uses only the keyboard for extended periods of time.

This Chrome extension makes it easier for you to click on links and stuff without taking your hands off your keyboard.

## How to use

Press `,` (comma) on your keyboard to show hints for all links, buttons, text fields and other things you can click or focus.

Press `.` (period) instead to open links in new tabs when they are clicked.

These shortcuts can be changed in the extension options.

Hints will be automatically triggered when possible. You can disable this in the extension options.

Press Escape to hide the hints.
